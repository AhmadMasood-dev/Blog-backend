Blog App Frontend Documentation
Overview
The Blog App Frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for a blog platform, allowing users to register, log in, view posts, read post details with comments, create/edit posts, and manage comments. The frontend interacts with a backend API (assumed to be RESTful) that handles data for users, posts, and comments.
Purpose

Provide an intuitive UI for users to interact with blog content.
Enable secure user authentication and authorization.
Facilitate CRUD operations for posts and comments via API calls.
Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.

Tech Stack

React: JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based UI.
React Router: For client-side routing and navigation.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive styling.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
Node.js/NPM: For managing dependencies and running the development server.
ESLint/Prettier (optional): For code linting and formatting.

Project Setup
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher): Install from nodejs.org.
Git: For version control.
Text Editor: VS Code or similar, with extensions for React and Tailwind CSS.

Installation

Clone the Repository (if hosted on GitHub or similar):git clone <repository-url>
cd blog-frontend


Install Dependencies:npm install


Set Up Tailwind CSS:
Initialize Tailwind configuration:npx tailwindcss init -p


Update tailwind.config.js:module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
};


Add Tailwind directives to src/index.css:@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;




Start the Development Server:npm start

The app will run at http://localhost:3000.

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root to configure the backend API URL:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api


Replace http://localhost:5000/api with your backend’s URL.
Access the variable in code using process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL.

Project Structure
The frontend follows a modular structure for maintainability:

Pages and Routes
The app uses React Router for navigation. Routes are defined in src/App.js:



Route
Component
Description
Protected?



/
Home
List all posts
No


/post/:id
PostDetail
Show a single post and comments
No


/login
Login
User login form
No


/register
Register
User registration form
No


/create-post
CreatePost
Form to create/edit a post
Yes


Protected Routes

Protected routes (e.g., /create-post) require authentication.
Implemented using a ProtectedRoute component that checks for a JWT token in localStorage.

Components
Reusable Components

Navbar (src/components/Navbar.js):
Displays the app title and navigation links (Home, Login, Register, Create Post, Logout).
Conditionally shows links based on authentication status.


PostCard (src/components/PostCard.js):
Renders a post preview (title, excerpt, “Read More” link).
Used in the Home page.


Comment (src/components/Comment.js):
Displays a single comment with the author’s name and content.
Includes a “Delete” button for the comment’s owner.



Page Components

Home (src/pages/Home.js):
Fetches and displays a list of posts using getPosts API.
Uses PostCard for each post.
Includes loading and error states.


PostDetail (src/pages/PostDetail.js):
Fetches a single post and its comments using getPost.
Allows authenticated users to add comments.
Displays a delete button for user-owned comments.


Login (src/pages/Login.js):
Form to collect email and password.
Calls login API and stores JWT token in localStorage.


Register (src/pages/Register.js):
Form to collect email, password, and other user details.
Calls register API.


CreatePost (src/pages/CreatePost.js):
Form to input post title and content.
Calls createPost or updatePost API.
Redirects to the post or home page after submission.



API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend via a RESTful API. API calls are managed in src/services/api.js using Axios.
Configuration

Base URL: Set in .env as REACT_APP_API_URL.
Axios Instance:
Configured with baseURL and Content-Type: application/json.
Intercepts requests to add Authorization: Bearer <token> if a token exists in localStorage.



API Endpoints
Assumed backend endpoints (adjust based on your actual API):



Resource
Endpoint
Method
Description



Users
/users/register
POST
Register a new user



/users/login
POST
Log in and return JWT token



/users/profile
GET
Get authenticated user’s profile


Posts
/posts
GET
List all posts



/posts
POST
Create a new post



/posts/:id
GET
Get a single post



/posts/:id
PUT
Update a post



/posts/:id
DELETE
Delete a post


Comments
/comments

API Functions
Defined in src/services/api.js:
// User APIs
export const register = (data) => api.post('/users/register', data);
export const login = (data) => api.post('/users/login', data);
export const getProfile = () => api.get('/users/profile');

// Post APIs
export const getPosts = () => api.get('/posts');
export const getPost = (id) => api.get(`/posts/${id}`);
export const createPost = (data) => api.post('/posts', data);
export const updatePost = (id, data) => api.put(`/posts/${id}`, data);
export const deletePost = (id) => api.delete(`/posts/${id}`);

// Comment APIs
export const addComment = (postId, data) => api.post(`/comments`, { ...data, postId });
export const deleteComment = (id) => api.delete(`/comments/${id}`);

Error Handling

API errors are caught in component try/catch blocks.
User-friendly error messages are displayed (e.g., “Failed to fetch posts”).
HTTP status codes (e.g., 401 Unauthorized) trigger appropriate actions (e.g., redirect to login).

Authentication

JWT Tokens:
Upon successful login, the backend returns a JWT token.
Stored in localStorage as token.
Sent in the Authorization header for protected API calls.


Protected Routes:
Routes like /create-post are wrapped in a ProtectedRoute component:function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  return token ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;
}




Logout:
Clears localStorage and redirects to /login.


Auth State:
Components like Navbar check localStorage.getItem('token') to determine if the user is authenticated.



Styling

Tailwind CSS:
Utility-first classes are used for styling (e.g., bg-blue-600, p-4, text-white).
Responsive design with classes like md:grid-cols-2 for different screen sizes.


Global Styles:
Defined in src/index.css.
Includes Tailwind directives and any custom CSS.


Component Styling:
Inline Tailwind classes are applied directly in JSX.
Example for a PostCard:<div className="bg-white p-4 rounded shadow">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">{post.title}</h3>
  <p className="text-gray-600">{post.content.substring(0, 100)}...</p>
</div>





Testing
Manual Testing

Navigation: Verify all routes load the correct components.
API Calls: Test fetching posts, creating posts, adding comments, etc.
Authentication:
Ensure unauthenticated users can’t access protected routes.
Test login/register/logout flows.


Responsive Design: Test on mobile and desktop viewports.

Automated Testing (Optional)

Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
Install dependencies:npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom


Example test for PostCard:import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import PostCard from './components/PostCard';

test('renders post title', () => {
  const post = { id: 1, title: 'Test Post', content: 'Content' };
  render(<PostCard post={post} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Test Post')).toBeInTheDocument();
});



Deployment
Build
Create a production-ready build:
npm run build


Outputs files to the build/ folder.

Hosting Options

Netlify:
Drag and drop the build/ folder to Netlify’s dashboard.
Or connect your GitHub repo for automatic deploys.


Vercel:
Run vercel CLI or import the repo in Vercel’s dashboard.


Static Server:
Serve the build/ folder using Nginx or an Express server.



Backend CORS

Ensure the backend allows requests from the frontend’s domain:
Development: http://localhost:3000.
Production: Your deployed frontend URL (e.g., https://blog-app.netlify.app).


Example CORS setup in a Node.js/Express backend:const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' }));



Performance Optimizations

Code Splitting:
Use React’s lazy and Suspense for dynamic imports:const Home = lazy(() => import('./pages/Home'));




Image Optimization:
Store images in src/assets/ and use optimized formats (e.g., WebP).


Memoization:
Use React.memo for components and useMemo/useCallback for expensive computations.


API Caching:
Cache API responses in state to avoid redundant requests.



Security

JWT Handling:
Store tokens in localStorage (or httpOnly cookies for better security).
Validate tokens on the backend for all protected routes.


Input Validation:
Validate form inputs on the frontend (e.g., required fields).
Rely on backend validation for security.


XSS Prevention:
React escapes JSX by default, preventing XSS.
Sanitize user inputs if rendering raw HTML (use libraries like DOMPurify).



Future Enhancements

State Management: Add Redux or Context API for complex state.
Rich Text Editor: Integrate react-quill for post creation.
Pagination: Implement pagination for the post list.
Search: Add a search bar to filter posts.
Profile Page: Allow users to view and edit their profiles.
Notifications: Show toast messages for actions (e.g., “Post created”).

Troubleshooting

CORS Errors:
Check backend CORS settings.
Verify REACT_APP_API_URL matches the backend URL.


API Failures:
Use browser DevTools (Network tab) to inspect requests.
Log errors in api.js or components.


Routing Issues:
Ensure BrowserRouter is used in App.js.
Verify route paths match component names.


Styling Issues:
Confirm Tailwind is initialized and index.css is imported.
Check for typos in Tailwind classes.
